.. image:: wideband.png
   :alt: Phonon dispersion with broadened bands.

This shows a phonon dispersion with bands broadened to indicate
scattering (the widest bands scatter the most). Via the command-line:

.. codeblock::
   tp plot wideband ../data/zno/band.yaml ../data/zno/kappa-m404021.hdf5 -c black -c red -s dark_background -p POSCAR

and in python:

.. literalinclude:: plot-wideband.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 16,19,23,24

This also demonstrates the custom colourmaps which can be generated by
supplying a single hex, rgb (array) or named colour as the colour
input, or in this case two (the default background is normally white,
but to match the ``dark_background`` style sheet, black has been used
here). In this case, ``tp.plot.colour.linear`` has been used. It also
shows the large style, more suitable to presentations or posters than
the default one which is more suited to papers. Instead of the actual
quantities you want to load, ``wideband`` can select all necessary for
this plot.

.. image:: prophon.png
   :alt: Phonon dispersion with phonon lifetime projected.

This shows a phonon dispersion with phonon lifetime projected on the
colour axis. It is a more quantitative version of the above wideband
plot. It can be plotted in python with:

.. literalinclude:: plot-projected-phonons.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 25-27
