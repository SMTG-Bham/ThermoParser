   :alt: Cumulative lattice thermal conductivity against frequency and mean free path.

This shows two plots of cumulative lattice thermal conductivity. The
first one is against frequency, and particularly in conjunction with a
density of states (DoS) or a phonon band structure, this can show the
relative contributions of the constituent atoms to the lattice thermal
conductivity. The second is against mean free path, and can be used to
approximate the effect of nanostructuring, for which reason the ability
to add markers has been included, e.g. here you can see nanostructuring
to 1 micron may reduce the lattice thermal conductivity by 20-25%.

This also demonstrates use of the add_legend function supplied with
relevant ``tp.axes`` functions, which combines the legends of all plots
and places itself in a pre-programmed position.
