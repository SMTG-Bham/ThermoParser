Here are some examples to help you get started with ThermoParser. The
numbered examples aim to provide a tutorial of how the package in
general works, while the rest show some more concrete examples you
might find in published work.

Some examples require large data files to run, which haven't been
included in the data folder, but can be downloaded using the
``get-data.sh`` script provided in the relevant directories. If
``wget`` doesn't work for you, navigate to the URL (``repo`` in
``get-data.sh``) in your browser to download the required file and add
it to the ``../data`` directory (``f`` in ``get-data.sh``).
